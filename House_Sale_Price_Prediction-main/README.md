Config files for my GitHub profile.
The goal of the project is that to predict the sale Price of the house based on Area, Light,public place, Garden,availability of requaried things.
IN this Project included some following steps, to make the model reliable,with less error and more accuracy.

● Prepared data for Analysis, drop Unnecessary columns, treat missing data.
● Explore the data using Exploratory Data Analysis- for Y and all X columns.
● Performed processes before training the model that is data preprocessing and EDA.
● Performed ANOVA test - to check the relationship between continuous and categorical columns. And also performed correlation to check the relationship between continuous columns.
● Used OLS model with backward elimination and Dropped unnecessary columns on basis of p-value to increase the model reliability.
● Used Algorithm like Multiple Linear Regression and also used Ridge and Lasso Penalty to get best accuracy and less error.
